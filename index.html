            Doug and Olivia(the couple known as Dolivia) love to cruise! Unfortunately, their cruising dreams are
            currently
            on pause
            due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. It's ok thought. As much as they love being on a ship, they can't picture it
            being
            much fun being stuck on a ship under a long quarantine. They are, of course, hopeful that the cruising
            industry will
            survive and
            they'll be able
            to
            resume cruising sometime in the future.
            Until then, let's help them relive those happy moments aboard a ship.
        </p>

        <h3> <i class="fas fa-ship"></i>About Cruising <i class="fas fa-ship"></i></h3>

        <p>
            Before digging into the couple's cruising adventure, lets review some basic cruising information for those
            who
            haven't had the joy of traveling by sea.
            <a href="#adventure">(Click here if you're only
                interested in reading about the couple's cruising adventure and want to skip this long informative
                section.)</a> It is
            unkown how many
            cruises Doug has been
            on, but
            he's what one would call a seasoned cruiser. He started
            cruising way before they met, and by now has earned Gold VFIP status with
            Carnival Cruise Lines. Since Olivia has only been on two cruises, her status is stuck on red.
            <br>
            <br>
            Olivia's first cruise took place in the Carnival Immagination ship which sailed out of Long Beach, CA. It
            lasted
            four
            days. The second cruise lasted 5 days and took place on Carnival's Dream ship sailing out of
            Galveston,
            TX. This ship was bigger and had a few more ammenities. </p>

        <p>Her are a couple short youtube videos with tours of each of the ships.<br>

        </p>

        <p>In case you haven't heard by now, Carnival Imagination was removed from the Carnival fleet roster earlier
            this year. The ship's last
            known whereabouts is Aliaga, Turkey where it is being scrapped. If you've ever wondered where ships go to
            die, here is a short newsclip with plenty of info. Warning, due to the graphic nature of this story, viewer
            discretion is advised.

        <p>Have you heard heard someone say that cruise ships are like small floating cities? Think about it, they
            have theaters, gyms, spas, restaurants, mini-golf, pools, water parks, dance clubs, tons of bars, a
            casino, etc...
            Plus they host a lot of fun activities, so there is almost always something to do or see. If you are onboard
            on Halloween, be ready to get dressed up.

        <br>
        Now, for those
        that are prone to seasickness, you can leave those worries behind. These ships are built with stabilizers,
        so
        most of the time you can't even tell you're at sea. Most of the time.</p>

        <p>
            In terms of cost, when you take into consideration all that is included with the cost of a cruise: the
            room, food, entertainment, etc., it is actually affordable for many people. Cruise lines also offer payment
            plans so you
            don't have to pay for it all at once. Here's a short list of some of the things that are typically
            included:

        <p>
            In regards to food, cruisers have the option of eating at the buffet, or dining room. No matter where
            you
            eat, there's always a variety of dishes to choose from. For those who want an actual restaurant experice
            with a full course meal,
            eating at the dining room is the best choice. The service is great, and the menu changes everyday. They
            even
            offer exotic food choices such as alligator, frog legs, escargot, etc. So, there's plenty of
            opportunities
            to try something new.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h7 id="drinks">What about drinks?</h7>
            The cruise price includes basics drinks:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><i class="fas fa-anchor"></i> non-bottled water</li>
            <li><i class="fas fa-anchor"></i> lemonade</li>

        <p>
            Carnival offers an all-inclusive Cheers beverage program which lets you enjoy a variety of alcoholic &
            non-alcoholic drinks at a fixed cost. A beverage
            program is
            a
            great
            idea for someone who plans on consuming alcoholic and specialty non-alcoholic drinks throughout the
            cruise
            without worrying
            about ending up with a huge bill afterwards. These were just a few things to consider if have
            never cruised before and are ready to discover the world of cruising. Once it's safe to cruise again, of
            course.

        <h6 id="adventure"> <i class="fas fa-ship"></i>Happy Days at Sea <i class="fas fa-ship"></i></h6>

        <p>When Doug was planning Olivia's first cruise, he had to decide how long they should sail for and
            which
            port to sail out of. Since it was Olivia's first cruise and they didn't
            know if she would get sea sick or if she would even like being on a ship, he opted for a short 4 day
            cruise.
            It appears to have been the right
            choice. Olivia had so much fun, and for a newbie the 4 days at sea felt just about right. Sailing
            out of
            California was also a great idea; it gave them the chance to visit Los Angeles, San Diego, Las
            Vegas,
            and Tijuana,
            Mexico. As you can imagine, the second half of their trip involved A LOT of driving. We'll have to
            cover
            their road
            adventure in another blog. For now, let's dive in to their high-seas adventure.

        </p>

        <p>
            Remember the Cheers beverage package mentioned in the previous section? <a href="#drinks">(Click here if
                you had skipped
                it and now you're curious.)</a>
            Well, Olivia decided to take advantage of the program and as a result, was able to consume a high volume
            of cocktails she had never tried before. And she found it... the perfect drink which instantly became
            her all-time
            favorite: the chocolatini. If you
            like chocolate and have never tried a chocolate martini, aka chocolatini, you must! Just don't drink
            too
            many at once
            because you
            can't taste the alcohol, but trust me, it's there!
            <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Dolivia thought the quality of the shows and
            entertainment were very good. They were able to go to all the stage shows and even stayed up past their
            bedtime to hang
            out at the late night adult comedy club. These were some of the funniest comedians they had ever seen.
            (I bet the Cheers beverage program had something to do with this.)
            Overall, they had a blast. In their reviews, Dolivia gave Carnival an A+ in the entertainment category.
        </p>

        <p> While planning their vacation, one of the couple's goals was to visit another country, and they agreed
            that traveling by ship was a better
            option
            than taking a plane. Why not have a vacation while traveling to another vacation. You can't really
            vacation while flying on a plane, can you? Ok, let's move on and find out what places they were able to
            visit.
        </p>

        <h3> <i class="fas fa-ship"></i>Baja, Mexico <i class="fas fa-ship"></i></h3>

        <h4><i class="fas fa-anchor"></i> 1st stop: Beautiful Catalina Island</h4>

        <p>
            <a target="_blank" href="images/catalina.JPG">
                <img src="images/catalina.JPG" alt="Catalina" width="300" height="100">
            </a>
            <br>
            Catalina is a small island about 22 miles from Los Angeles. Dolivia spent the day in the town of Avalon,
            mostly
            shopping and hanging out at a the beach. Since Olivia was raised in California, she went to the beach
            A LOT,
            and
            to this day, it's the one thing she truly misses about living in California. The water, the sand, the
            sun, the palmtrees, you get the idea.
            So, for her, being able to spend
            time at this tiny beach in Catalina Island was the highlight of this excursion.</p>

        <h4><i class="fas fa-anchor"></i> 2nd stop: Ensenada, Baja California</h4>

        <p>Ensenada is popular seaport town in Baja California, Mexico. It is located approximately 80 miles
            south
            of
            San
            Diego,
            California, and is a popular tourist destination. There's a lot to do and see there, so Dolivia
            decided to join a City and Shopping Tour. The tour guide spoke very good English, and very informative.
            So, what did we get to see and do? Actually, quite a bit. </p>

        <p>They toured the historic
            <a href="https://www.bajabound.com/bajaadventures/bajastoryteller/hotel_riviera_del_pacifico.php"
                target="_blank">Riviera
                Cultural Center. </a>
            I had actually never heard of this place. According to the tour guide, this place was built in the late
            20's to
            early 30's and was originally known as the Playa
            Ensenada Hotel & Casino. Apparently, it was very popular among the USA rich and famous who used to
            travel to Ensenada to drink and party during the Prohibition. Unfotunately things went downhill around
            the mid 30's once gambling became illegal in
            Mexico. There is a lot of interesting history and beautiful architecture; there's even a map of all the
            Spanish Missions. As a cool treat, the tour concludes with a visit to the Andaluz bar, which is located
            inside the building. Everyone got to sample a free and delicious margarita drink. Delicioso!</p>

        <p>According to the tour guide, the world famous Margarita cocktail was invented in this bar in honor of
            Marjorie King. However, the origin of the margarita is a bit of a mystery. From what I've recently read,
            there are many people/bars claiming credit for
            inventing
            the
            Margarita. If you are curious about the cocktail's possible origin, check out these links and let me
            know
            what
            you think.

        <p>The tour wasn't over, the next stop was at
            <a href="http://santo-tomas.com/" target="_blank">Bodegas de Santo Tomas </a> for a sampling of
            their
            wines,
            while also
            enjoying
            a spread of
            cheeses,
            bread, and olive oils. Delicioso!</p>

        <p>A note about purchasing alcohol ashore. You are required to turn it in to the cruise line;
            they will hold it for you and you get to pick it up during debarkation. So, purchasing alcohol ashore to
            drink back on the ship won't work.
            However, that probably won't matter much to someone who has the Cheers beverage program because
            they get to drink whatever they want as soon as they get back to the ship.</p>

        <p><b>In search of <a href="http://www.streetgourmetla.com/2010/11/ultimate-guide-to-best-fish-tacos-in.html"
                    target="_blank">the best Fish Taco.
                </a>
            </b>
            <br>
            Have you ever tried a baja-style fish taco? If not, you are missing out. They are delicious and my
            all-time
            favorite
            type of
            taco. For many people, once they try their first fish taco, they are hooked.
        </p>

        <p>Similarly to the Margarita, Ensenada also claims to be the home of the original fish taco. So, anyone
            that is a
            fish
            taco
            fan, this is the place to feast. Since there are so many
            places in Ensenada that sell fish tacos, it's hard to decide which place to stop at. Instead of shopping
            during their tour, Dolivia decided to have a walking adventure, which led them to La
            Marina
            area,
            near the
            <a href=" https://www.facebook.com/TIJUANATRIPS/videos/mercado-negro-fish-market-ensenada-baja-ca/480856212702095/"
                target="_blank">Mercado
                Negro Fish Market.</a>


            They figured that the restaurants surrounding the fish market would probably be using fresh fish from
            the neighboring market for their
            tacos. After so many options, they chose a place called Tacos Ensenada. The tacos and salsas served at
            this tiny
            corner
            taqueria were delicious. If you would like to see the part of town they were at, click on the Mercado
            Negro link above. You can actually see the corner taco spot the couple ate at. Fun times!

        <p>You see, Olivia is a workaholic. In the last couple of years, she's been working 2 jobs, averaging 60-70
            hours per week. Since she's always on the go and gets very little rest, the thing that she craves the
            most
            in a vacation is
            relaxation. She needs and wants time to recover, and give her mind, body and soul the break it needs.
            So, when Doug
            suggested skipping the exhausting activities for a day and instead
            spend time relaxing at the beach, she was all in.</p>

        <p>Mr Sancho's was exactly the right place for her to be in; beautiful clear ocean water, comfy warm sand,
            plus all-you-can
            eat
            and
            drink. What else could one ask for?
            A massage you say? They have that too. Yes, there were a lot of people there, and some areas were a bit
            on the crowded side. However, Dolivia got there early and landed a
            spot on a side
            of the beach that wasn't crowded. It
            was so relaxing; just sitting, eating, drinking, swimming, laying out in the sand. Exactly what Olivia
            needed!

        <p>Exploring the
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcRIlTUXSuU" target="_blank">Uxmal Mayan Ruins</a>.</p>

        <p>Olivia was born in Mexico, and came to the US as a young child. She has only been able to travel back
            there on very few
            occasions. So, she was super excited to visit an actual ancient city and learn about her culture. The
            pyramids, architecture, carvings, ceremonial
            sites,
            ball
            court, and even the iguanas; she loved seeing a side of Mexico she had never seen before. This was way
            better than reading about it in a book or visting a
            museum.
